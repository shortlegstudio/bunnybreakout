# Bunny Breakout

A Unity game based on the original brick busting classic.

## About

This project was created as a simple practice project to mess around with some Unity features. The code is not particularly well organized at this point. It also doesn't represent any ideal way to approach problems. It does show a lot of experimentation to solve various issues in order to explore how the ECS (Entity-Component System) of Unity works and how to best utilize the scripting system that supports it.

## Learnings

* In working through this it's obvious that there is lots of potential in utilizing the scripting DLL's to provide more functionality than might be apparent at first.
* Designing scripts for game objects requires some forethought. The best scripts seem to focus on behaviors in general. I kept falling into a problem where I'd want a script to just do one more thing. Constant refactoring of scripts seems necessary as projects grow.
* Games are hard to build not for the building but for the playability.
* Good art helps
* Making sounds is fun
